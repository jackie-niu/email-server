# email-server
Email server and client made using Java

This was made as a school project, and can be used by anyone affiliated with the TDSB (Toronto District School Board).

Please read "How to run the email server.txt" to read how the server works.

Before running, there must be three files; _account.dat, _message.dat and _available.dat. These files will store account data, message data and deleted message data, respectively.
